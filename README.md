# AluraBooks bookstore

This project implements a _reponsive webpage_ for _AluraBooks_, a fictional online shop for books related to programming and IT in general.

The webpage can be accessed [here](https://af0liveira.github.io/alura-books/).

## Starting point

The implementation is based on
[this Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3M3i3rZtK8EPhrGfUTOvwl/AluraBooks-(Copy)?node-id=37%3A94&mode=dev),
which contains specs for mobile, tablet, and desktop versions of the webpage.[^figma]

[^figma]: This Figma project was copied from [here](https://www.figma.com/file/sSMbIqKaGBd66Y8roxTk2p/AluraBooks) on 2023-09-18 without any further modification.

## Mobile first

The implementation followed a _mobile-first approach_, in which the mobile version is implemented first and versions for larger screens build up on it using _media queries_ to modify the components accordingly.

## Technologies used in this project

This project is fully implemented with

- HTML
- CSS
- [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/)
