# AluraBooks bookstore

This project implements a webpage for _AluraBooks_, a fictional online shop for books related to programming and IT in general.

The implementation is based on
[this Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/EMTTyMTAnhO1v69L3DjWdl/AluraBooks-(Copy)?node-id=126%3A4397&mode=dev)
which contains specs for mobile, tablet, and desktop versions of the webpage.[^figma]

[^figma]: This Figma project was copied from [here](https://www.figma.com/file/sSMbIqKaGBd66Y8roxTk2p/AluraBooks) on 2023-09-18 without any further modification.

Following a _mobile-first approach_, the mobile version takes priority in the development.
